title: Outsourced .NET SDK Service

  Information on my .NET SDK service to assist companies with creating and maintaining a proper set of .NET SDKs for their APIs.
---

Having a proper suite of .NET SDKs, documentation and code samples ensures that .NET developers can more easily integrate with your application and can give you a distinct advantage over your competition in the eyes of these developers.

Are you a company that need .NET SDKs developed for your application and APIs, but you do not have the in-house resources to handle this?

I offer an **outsourced .NET SDK service** that can assist you with creating, publishing and supporting .NET SDKs without requiring you to bring a full-time .NET developer on board.

This service covers the following:

* Developing, maintaining and publishing .NET SDKs for your APIs
* Creating and publishing documentation and READMEs for these SDKs
* Developing code samples and quickstarts to assist developers in integrating your APIs into their applications more easily
* Develop a full suite of unit and integration tests and setting up Continuous Integration (CI) to run these for all pull requests and releases
* Configuring Continuous Delivery (CD) to handle deployment to NuGet and MyGet
* Triage and respond to GitHub issues and pull requests, as well as configuring GitHub issue and pull requests templates
* Working with your support team to ensure that they have the correct knowledge to support developers using the .NET SDKs 
* Working with your development team to ensure that the .NET SDKs support new features added to your APIs in a timely manner

I am a software developer with more than 25 years of experience. In this time I have used many 3rd party libraries and SDKs, and so I have a good understanding of what makes for a great developer experience.

Most of the past five years have been spent creating and maintaining both open source .NET libraries, as well as maintaining .NET SDKs for commercial clients.
